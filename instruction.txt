Instructions to Run the Retail Sales Forecasting Project
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>

2. Set Up Python Environment

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env


Activate it:

Windows: env\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux: source env/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

Install all required libraries using requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Notebook

Open Retail_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.

If using Colab, you may need to install missing libraries in a cell:

!pip install -q dash jupyter-dash pyngrok prophet tensorflow

5. Run Forecasting Models

Step through the notebook cells sequentially.

Each block explains:

Data generation & preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time series forecasting: ARIMA, Holt-Winters, Prophet, LSTM

Inventory optimization calculation

Dashboard creation using Dash

6. Launch Interactive Dashboard

If running locally, in VS Code or Jupyter:

app.run(port=8050)


If using Colab:

Use pyngrok to expose the dashboard:

from pyngrok import ngrok
public_url = ngrok.connect(8050)
print(public_url)


Open the printed URL in your browser.

7. Explore Scenarios

Select forecast models from the dropdown

Adjust forecast horizon

Apply promotion or holiday effects

View recommended inventory levels
